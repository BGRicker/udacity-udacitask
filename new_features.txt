Feature 1: Magic List
- This method, used to quickly add items to to-do lists, will take a whole
string, separated by commas, and add them to a previous TodoList object:

cool_list = TodoList.new("A cool list")
cool_list.magic_list("go to the store, buy a pizza, cook the pizza, eat the
pizza")

After creating a TodoList, you can call .magic_list on that new TodoList. You
pass in a string to magic_list, and that string creates multiple todo items at a
time split up by commas. Above we have "to go the store, buy a pizza, cook the
pizza, eat the pizza," so we can expect four items in the todo list:

cool_list.print_list # this will output this:

A cool list
----------
go to the store
buy a pizza
cook the pizza
eat the pizza

Feature 2: Split View
- This is a different way of displaying your tasks, first showing completed
tasks and then the incomplete tasks. Calling this method on a list will show
this output:

A cool list
----------
Completed Tasks: 1
         - go to the store

Incomplete Tasks: 3
         - buy a pizza
         - cook the pizza
         - eat the pizza

First the count of Completed tasks are shown, then the tasks themselves. The
same is done for the incompleted tasks afterward.
